## Contributions
I used information I found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23097859/javascript-prompt-validation), [MDN Webdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join), and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_while.asp) to help me understand how to join arrays, use while loops, and validate responses in my code.

I also recieved a great deal of help from two of my peers, Vidal and Neema who were able to look over my code and help me rewrite areas where I previously had errors or could not get to function properly.
